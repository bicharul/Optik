# Bug Report

## Bug Identification

*   **File:** `index.html`
*   **Line number:** 55
*   **Description:** The navigation link for the "Collections" page has an incorrect `href` attribute. It points to `collections.html` (with an "s"), while the actual file is named `collection.html` (without an "s").

## Impact

When a user clicks on the "Collections" link in the navigation bar on the main page, they are directed to a non-existent page, resulting in a "404 File Not Found" error. This creates a broken user experience and prevents users from accessing the collections page.

## Proposed Fix

The fix involves correcting the `href` attribute in the anchor tag for the "Collections" link within `index.html`. The value will be changed from `collections.html` to `collection.html` to match the correct filename.

This will be verified by a new test that programmatically checks the link's `href` attribute.
